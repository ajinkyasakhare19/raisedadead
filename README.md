### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile.

Currently, I am working on full stack Open Source projects in JavaScript, with
modern technologies, frameworks and libraries, like Node.js, React, Express,
MongoDB & related ecosystems.

I am well versed in deploying applications to most cloud service providers, including
DigitalOcean, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure & Others.

Previously, I have worked on modern Computer Vision technologies in JavaScript,
like Three.js & WebGL. And in the earlier days, I have worked largely on Windows
platforms, including developing apps in MFC, COM & C++.

I am a hardcore music addict and Open Source enthusiast. When not hooked to my
notebook, I love going to rock gigs, and traveling the world with friends.

Cheers.
